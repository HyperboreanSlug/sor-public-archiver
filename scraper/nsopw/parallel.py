"""Parallel, per-jurisdiction report fetching for the NSOPW builder.

The NSOPW *search* API (nsopw-api.ojp.gov) is a single Cloudflare-protected
host and stays serialized in the builder. The heavy, parallelizable work is
fetching each offender's **report page from their state's registry website**
(iCrimeWatch, OffenderWatch, state DPS sites, …).

``JurisdictionReportPool`` runs those report fetches on a configurable number
of worker threads while guaranteeing a hard invariant:

    **No two worker threads ever hit the same state website at the same time.**

This is enforced by keying work on jurisdiction: a jurisdiction is marked
"active" while any worker is fetching one of its URLs, and no other worker may
claim a job for an active jurisdiction. Each jurisdiction also has its own
minimum-interval limiter so per-state pacing (the report delay) is respected.

Workers only perform network + file I/O. They never touch the sqlite database
(that stays single-threaded on the caller): each worker owns its own HTTP
session (``make_fetcher``) and returns the enriched job to the caller for
insertion.
