"""Mugshot-based ethnicity / race scoring for high-confidence verification.

Uses **local open-source** face models — nothing is sent to a cloud API.

Primary backend: `DeepFace <https://github.com/serengil/deepface>`_ (race
attribute model). Install once::

    pip install -r requirements-vision.txt

Two workflows:

1. **Verify** — combine face scores with surname-based ethnicity to confirm or
   reject a registry race label for a single person (or a name-misclass list).
2. **Scan** — walk archived mugshots independently and flag gross mismatches
   (e.g. face scores Black/Indian at high confidence while race is White).

``auto`` never falls back to mock. Unit tests pass ``backend='mock'`` only.
